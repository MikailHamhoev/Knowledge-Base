* JDK, JRE, and JVM

The Java platform is built on three main layers, with the JVM at the core, the JRE surrounding it, and the JDK as the outernost layer meant for development.

** Java Virtual Machine
Platform-dependent engine that runs Java programs. It takes the Java bytecode (.class files) and converts in into machine code. Handles memory management and garbage collection.

** Java Runtime Environment
A software package that provides the minimum requirements to run Java applications. JRE = JVM + Core Libraries (like java.lang, java.util, java.io and other supporting files).

** Java Development Kit
A software package used to develop Java applications. JDK = JRE + Development Tools (like javac).
